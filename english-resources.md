With the basics in mind, it is time to start coding your first Android app. To begin you need to [setup Android Studio and the Android SDK](http://goo.gl/X2SVFR). The Android SDK is actually a bundle of helpful tools consisting of Android libraries, an emulator, a debugger, and documentation. It also gives you a framework of Java classes and methods that all Android devices are able to use, the core Android library. You'll have to update this library as new versions come out, but more on that later. The whole SDK is packaged inside Android Studio, allowing you to only worry about your code and how devices implement it.

When learning Android it’s not about learning how to code, it’s more about understanding the way that Android works. That means that you’ll spend the majority of the time learning about [[Activity Lifecycle|Activity-Lifecycle]], [[Fragments|Creating-and-Using-Fragments]], [[ListViews|Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView]], [[Intents|Using-Intents-to-Create-Flows]], and other important Android specific concepts as opposed to algorithms or data structures. 

### Courses

* [Common tasks](http://developer.android.com/guide/faq/commontasks.html) is a useful list from Google of typical things you can do in your app with links to explanations on how to do them. 

### Tutorials

The following tutorials attempt to explain aspects of Android development step-by-step:

* [Google Codelabs for Android Tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/?cat=Android) - Interesting interactive tutorial for learning Android step-by-step.

* [Android UI Tutorial: Layouts and Animations](https://www.codementor.io/android/tutorial/android-ui-layouts-animations-mirror) - a quick live coding of Android UI creations and shows how to use the different layouts, Views (TextView, ListView, ImageView, GridView, RecyclerView) and Motions (Property Animation, drawable Animation) by live coding. 

### Video Resources

The following video lessons present on the basics of Android development:

* [The Android Development Tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z149x12sXsw) by Derek Banas is great for those who prefer video lessons. It has 25 video lessons in total ranging from 10 to 30 minutes each. Note that he teaches in Eclipse instead of Android Studio.

### Apps

The following apps can be a useful examples when getting started:

* [Open-source Apps](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Sample-Android-Apps) provides a list of the open-source sample apps that can be used as a resource when first getting started on Android. These sample apps can be a great help in understanding how all the pieces fit together.

* [DevAppsDirect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.inappsquared.devappsdirect&hl=en) is another great app you can get from the Play Store. While it also won't teach you how to develop an app, it will show you what is available out there. The app maintains a list of open source libraries you can use in your project for a variety of purposes. Knowing what you can reuse will save you a lot of time in the future.
